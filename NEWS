0.3.0svn
========
- The icon bar is now sized and rendered properly with all Gtk+ theme engines.
- New translations: Dwayne Bailey (en_GB)


0.2.0
=====
- The ellipsizing functions now use the Pango 1.6 builtin functionality
  if available.
- Added lightweight session management support with the ExoXsessionClient
  class.
- The API of ExoEllipsizedLabel was changed to be compatible with GtkLabel
  in Gtk+ 2.5 and above.
- Added an ellipsizing cell renderer ExoCellRendererEllipsizedText, compatible
  with GtkCellRendererText in Gtk+ 2.6.
- ExoIconBar has an "orientation" property now. The "selection-changed" signal
  has been renamed to "changed". The ExoIconBar background is updated when
  the Gtk style changes.
- libexo is fully internationalized now. German translations are already
  available.
- The ExoToolbarsView class has been changed to provide a "Customize 
  Toolbars..." menu item together with the other items and to emit a
  signal "customize".
- ExoPropertyProxy has been replaced by ExoBinding, which is based on
  the GObject Binding Properties implementation available from
  http://ex-code.com/glib-bind/. ExoBinding is way more powerful and
  easier to handle than ExoPropertyProxy. ExoBinding contains some 
  improvements over GBinding; for example, GBinding can run into an
  endless loop, when you bind properties of type GBoxed, whereas
  ExoBinding doesn't suffer from this problem.
- The MD5 functions have been changed to be compatible with the MD5 API
  found in libegg.
- The API documentation is nearly complete now.

0.1.3
=====
- Added a framework for editable toolbars (ExoToolbarsModel, ExoToolbarsView,
  ExoToolbarsEditor and ExoToolbarsEditorDialog).
- Added initial API reference documentation.
- Added version information variables and macros similar to whats used
  in Xfce and Gtk+.


0.1.2
=====
- Fixed a style problem with the iconbar.
- Fixed a bug in the md5 module, that caused the libexo compile to fail
  on some GNU/Linux systems.
- The configure option --enable-final now enables linker optimizations for
  plattforms that support it (recent GNU binutils required).


0.1.1
=====
- An ICE module was added, based upon the ice-layer from xfce4-session and
  the gnome-ice module of libgnomeui.
- libexo no longer requires SSL on non-BSD systems, since a MD5 fallback
  implementation was added, which will be used if the system doesn't
  provide MD5_* functions.
