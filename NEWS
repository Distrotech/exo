0.3.1.5svn
==========
- Imported the "Xfce Preferred Applications" framework, which allows users to
  select their preferred applications (i.e. web browser, mail reader, terminal
  emulator) using a nice graphical interface, rather than having to figure out
  where to add which environment variable to make Xfce use Firefox as default
  web browser.
- Updated the ExoIconView class to support an API compatible to the GtkIconView
  in Gtk+ 2.8, and improve the performance of the icon view.
- Added single click navigation support to ExoIconView.
- Added hover-selection support to ExoIconView in single-click mode, which
  automatically selects an item when the mouse is paused over it for a
  certain amount of time.
- Added "Right Arrow Keyboard Navigation" to ExoIconView, as suggested in
  http://chabada.sk/better-desktop/#nautilus-improvements.
- Added a compact layout mode to ExoIconView, similar to the list view found
  in Windows Explorer.
- Added a new widget ExoTreeView, which extends GtkTreeView with single click
  navigation.
- Added a new widget ExoWrapTable, which layouts its child widgets in an
  automatically wrapped table. For example, this is used for the emblem
  chooser in Thunar.
- Added a new utility exo-csource, which can generate C source code from
  arbitrary data.
- Added various new convenience functions to make dealing with strings,
  pixbufs and other data structures easier for C programmers.
- Updated class structures to make sure constant static strings aren't
  unnecessarily duplicated at runtime, and provide other packages with
  the same functionality by exporting the functions and macros in
  question.
- Updated the python bindings to include the new functionality.
- Support three different levels of debugging support (yes/minimum/no).
- New translations: Pau RulÂ·lan Ferragut (ca), Stavros Giannouris (el),
                    Patricio Carr (es), Piarres Beobide (eu), Jari Rahkonen

0.3.0
=====
- The icon bar is now sized and rendered properly with all Gtk+ theme engines.
- The following obsolete components have been removed: ExoIce, ExoFileWatch,
  ExoUri and ExoPropertyProxy.
- A bug in ExoCellRendererEllipsizedText was fixed, which caused Xfmedia to
  crash under certain circumstances.
- The dependency on D-BUS is gone.
- Python bindings have been added.
- Updated API documentation.
- New translations: Dwayne Bailey (en_GB)


0.2.0
=====
- The ellipsizing functions now use the Pango 1.6 builtin functionality
  if available.
- Added lightweight session management support with the ExoXsessionClient
  class.
- The API of ExoEllipsizedLabel was changed to be compatible with GtkLabel
  in Gtk+ 2.5 and above.
- Added an ellipsizing cell renderer ExoCellRendererEllipsizedText, compatible
  with GtkCellRendererText in Gtk+ 2.6.
- ExoIconBar has an "orientation" property now. The "selection-changed" signal
  has been renamed to "changed". The ExoIconBar background is updated when
  the Gtk style changes.
- libexo is fully internationalized now. German translations are already
  available.
- The ExoToolbarsView class has been changed to provide a "Customize 
  Toolbars..." menu item together with the other items and to emit a
  signal "customize".
- ExoPropertyProxy has been replaced by ExoBinding, which is based on
  the GObject Binding Properties implementation available from
  http://ex-code.com/glib-bind/. ExoBinding is way more powerful and
  easier to handle than ExoPropertyProxy. ExoBinding contains some 
  improvements over GBinding; for example, GBinding can run into an
  endless loop, when you bind properties of type GBoxed, whereas
  ExoBinding doesn't suffer from this problem.
- The MD5 functions have been changed to be compatible with the MD5 API
  found in libegg.
- The API documentation is nearly complete now.

0.1.3
=====
- Added a framework for editable toolbars (ExoToolbarsModel, ExoToolbarsView,
  ExoToolbarsEditor and ExoToolbarsEditorDialog).
- Added initial API reference documentation.
- Added version information variables and macros similar to whats used
  in Xfce and Gtk+.


0.1.2
=====
- Fixed a style problem with the iconbar.
- Fixed a bug in the md5 module, that caused the libexo compile to fail
  on some GNU/Linux systems.
- The configure option --enable-final now enables linker optimizations for
  plattforms that support it (recent GNU binutils required).


0.1.1
=====
- An ICE module was added, based upon the ice-layer from xfce4-session and
  the gnome-ice module of libgnomeui.
- libexo no longer requires SSL on non-BSD systems, since a MD5 fallback
  implementation was added, which will be used if the system doesn't
  provide MD5_* functions.
