Variables and macros to check the exo version

<!-- ##### SECTION Long_Description ##### -->
<para>
Exo provides version information, primarily useful in configure for
builds that have a configure script. Applications may use it to
check if a certain feature is available in the version of libexo
they are being built against or being linked with.
</para>

<!-- ##### SECTION See_Also ##### -->
<para>

</para>

<!-- ##### VARIABLE exo_major_version ##### -->
<para>
The major version number of the exo library (e.g. in libexo 0.1.3
this is 0).
</para>
<para>
This variable is in the library, and therefore represents the exo
library you have linked against. Contrast with the #EXO_MAJOR_VERSION
macro, which represents the major version of the libexo headers
you have included.
</para>


<!-- ##### VARIABLE exo_minor_version ##### -->
<para>
The minor version number of the exo library (e.g. in libexo 0.1.3
this is 1).
</para>
<para>
This variable is in the library, and therefore represents the exo
library you have linked against. Contrast with the #EXO_MINOR_VERSION
macro, which represents the minor version of the libexo headers
you have included.
</para>


<!-- ##### VARIABLE exo_micro_version ##### -->
<para>
The micro version number of the exo library (e.g. in libexo 0.1.3
this is 3).
</para>
<para>
This variable is in the library, and therefore represents the exo
library you have linked against. Contrast with the #EXO_MICRO_VERSION
macro, which represents the micro version of the libexo headers
you have included.
</para>


<!-- ##### MACRO EXO_MAJOR_VERSION ##### -->
<para>
Like #exo_major_version, but from the headers used at application
compile time, rather than from the library linked against at
application run time.
</para>



<!-- ##### MACRO EXO_MINOR_VERSION ##### -->
<para>
Like #exo_minor_version, but from the headers used at application
compile time, rather than from the library linked against at
application run time.
</para>



<!-- ##### MACRO EXO_MICRO_VERSION ##### -->
<para>
Like #exo_micro_version, but from the headers used at application
compile time, rather than from the library linked against at
application run time.
</para>



<!-- ##### MACRO EXO_CHECK_VERSION ##### -->
<para>
Returns %TRUE if the version of the libexo header files is 
equal or better than the passed-in version.
</para>

@major: major version (e.g. 0 for version 0.1.3)
@minor: minor version (e.g. 1 for version 0.1.3)
@micro: micro version (e.g. 3 for version 0.1.3)
