What is this?
=============

exo-mount is a volume mounter, which is used to mount, eject or unmount volumes
based on their HAL UDIs or their device files. The HAL support is optional, but
highly recommended. See the output of

	exo-mount --help

for available command line options.

For the mount options used by HAL, see the mount.rc file installed by exo in the
$prefix/etc/xdg/xfce4 directory.
