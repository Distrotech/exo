{"name":"Exo","tagline":"Mirror of git://git.xfce.org/xfce/exo","body":"What is it?\r\n===========\r\n\r\nThis is libexo, an extension library to Xfce, developed by os-cillation. While\r\nXfce comes with quite a few libraries that are targeted at desktop development,\r\nlibexo is targeted at application development.\r\n\r\n\r\nCurrent state\r\n=============\r\n\r\nlibexo is considered ready for production use. You do no longer need to\r\ndefine the EXO_API_SUBJECT_TO_CHANGE preprocessor symbol.\r\n\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n============\r\n\r\nThe file 'INSTALL' contains generic installation instructions.\r\n\r\n\r\nDebugging Support\r\n=================\r\n\r\nlibexo currently supports three different levels of debugging support, which\r\ncan be setup using the configure flag `--enable-debug' (check the output of\r\n`configure --help'):\r\n\r\n  `yes'\t\tThis is the default for SVN snapshot builds. It adds all kinds\r\n  \t\tof checks to the code, and is therefore likely to run slower.\r\n\t\tUse this for development of libexo and locating bugs in libexo.\r\n\r\n  `minimum'\tThis is the default for release builds. This is the recommended\r\n  \t\tbehaviour.\r\n\r\n  `no'\t\tDisables all sanity checks. Don't use this unless you know\r\n  \t\texactly what you do.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow to report bugs?\r\n===================\r\n\r\nBugs should be reported to the Xfce bug tracking system\r\n(http://bugzilla.xfce.org, product libexo). You will need\r\nto create an account for yourself.\r\n\r\nPlease read the HACKING file for information on where to send changes\r\nor bugfixes for this package.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
