Bug tracking system
===================

libexo uses the bug tracking system at http://bugs.os-cillation.com/
hosted and maintained by os-cillation.


Patches
=======

Please submit patches to the os-cillation bug tracking system or to the
people listed in the AUTHORS file. Your patch should be in unified diff
format (the -u option to GNU diff).

Please and send a patch against a recent version of this package. Patches
against the Subversion trunk branch are most preferable. You can always
access the trunk branch from 

  https://os-cillation.com:8080/websvn/listing.php?repname=libexo


Feature requests
================

Please file feature requests to the os-cillation bug tracking system
(http://bugs.os-cillation.com, product libexo) with a Severity of
enhancement. Make sure that your feature request wasn't reported already
before; requesting a feature several times won't increase the chance
that it gets added.


Coding Style
============

 - GNU coding conventions, with GLib-like extensions, mostly the same
   as GTK+.
 - Always expand tabs. This differs from the GNU suggestion, but is
   necessary!
