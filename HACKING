Coding Style
============

 - GNU coding conventions, with GLib-like extensions, mostly the same
   as GTK+.
 - Always expand tabs. This differs from the GNU suggestion, but is
   necessary!


Release process
===============

  1) Check out a fresh copy from Subversion
  2) Increment the version number in configure.ac
  3) Update NEWS and ChangeLog, and don't forget to add an entry
     ("Released x.y.z") to ChangeLog, so people can see which changes
     were before and after a given release.
  4) Check the gtk-doc.
  5) Run make update-po in po/ and update po/de.po (don't forget the header)!
  6) Unset libexo_version_tab in configure.ac and reset it after the
     release is done.
  7) Verify that make dist works.
  8) "svn commit" the changes.
  9) Create a simple tag for the release,
      "svn copy https://os-cillation.de:8080/repos/libexo/trunk \
         https://os-cillation.de:8080/repos/libexo/tags/release-X.Y.Z"
     where X.Y.Z is the version number.
 10) upload the tarball to os-cillation ftp
 11) Update freshmeat entry.
