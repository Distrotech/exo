What is this?
=============

exo-mount-notify is a small, internal utility used by exo-mount to display a
notification while unmounting/ejecting devices and a hint after a device was
unmounted that the user can remove the device.

This utility requires libnotify and a running notification daemon. exo-mount
will work even if exo-mount-notify is not installed, so libnotify is a soft
dependency.
